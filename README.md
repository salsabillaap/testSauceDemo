# Sauce Demo Testing
Welcome to Java Demo Scripts designed by Salsabilla Aliska Putri to provide examples of how to use Sauce Labs technology. This repository contains everything you need to get started with the web, visually, functionally, and all other types of automation using Java.

## General info
In this project, testing was carried out on several features contained in [Sauce Demo](https://www.saucedemo.com/)

Also, I've written some manual test cases that I managed in spreadsheet [web-manual test saucedemo](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m114w6ZqjW_gF9G2VGfBkqzQ2pLk4cgLtKHSZW2hy84/edit#gid=1230471539)

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Intellij IDEA Community 2022.1.1 - development environment for Java
* Selenium WebDriver - for automated testing of web applications
* Java 8 - basics of Java language
* Serenity with Cucumber
* Google Spreadsheet - test cases management
* Git, Git Bash, Github

## The starter project
The best place to start with Serenity and Cucumber is to clone or download the starter project on Github ([https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-cucumber-starter](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-cucumber-starter)). This project gives you a basic project setup, along with some sample tests and supporting classes. There are two versions to choose from. The master branch uses a more classic approach, using action classes and lightweight page objects, whereas the **[screenplay](https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-cucumber-starter/tree/screenplay)** branch shows the same sample test implemented using Screenplay.

### The project directory structure
The project has build scripts for both Maven and Gradle, and follows the standard directory structure used in most Serenity projects:
```Gherkin
src
  + main
  + test
    + java                        Test runners and supporting code
    + resources
      + features                  Feature files
     + search                  Feature file subdirectories 
             search_by_keyword.feature
```

Serenity 2.2.13 introduced integration with WebdriverManager to download webdriver binaries.

## The sample scenario
Both variations of the sample project uses the sample Cucumber scenario. In this scenario, Sergey (who likes to search for stuff) is performing a search on the internet:

```Gherkin
@test @positive
Scenario: Checkout item successfully
  Given user already add item to cart
  When user click on checkout button
  Then checkout: your information appear
  When user fill first name with "test"
  And user fill last name with "feature"
  And user fill zip postal code with "A5743"
  And user click on continue button
  Then checkout: overview page appear
```

### The Screenplay implementation
The sample code in the master branch uses the Screenplay pattern. The Screenplay pattern describes tests in terms of actors and the tasks they perform. Tasks are represented as objects performed by an actor, rather than methods. This makes them more flexible and composable, at the cost of being a bit more wordy. Here is an example:
```java
    @Steps
    CheckoutItemStep checkoutItemStep;

    @Given("user already add item to cart")
    public void userAlreadyAddItemToCart() {
            checkoutItemStep.addedItem();
            }
    
    @When("user click on checkout button")
    public void userClickOnCheckoutButton() {
            checkoutItemStep.clickCheckout();
            }
```
## Executing the tests
To run the sample project, you can either just run the `CucumberTestSuite` test runner class, or run either `mvn verify` or `gradle test` from the command line.

By default, the tests will run using Chrome. You can run them in Firefox by overriding the `driver` system property, e.g.
```json
$ mvn clean verify -Ddriver=firefox
```
Or
```json
$ gradle clean test -Pdriver=firefox
```

The test results will be recorded in the `target/site/serenity` directory.

## Generating the reports
Since the Serenity reports contain aggregate information about all of the tests, they are not generated after each individual test (as this would be extremenly inefficient). Rather, The Full Serenity reports are generated by the `serenity-maven-plugin`. You can trigger this by running `mvn serenity:aggregate` from the command line or from your IDE.

They reports are also integrated into the Maven build process: the following code in the `pom.xml` file causes the reports to be generated automatically once all the tests have completed when you run `mvn verify`?

```
             <plugin>
                <groupId>net.serenity-bdd.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>serenity-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>${serenity.maven.version}</version>
                <configuration>
                    <tags>${tags}</tags>
                </configuration>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <id>serenity-reports</id>
                        <phase>post-integration-test</phase>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>aggregate</goal>
                        </goals>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
```

## Simplified WebDriver configuration and other Serenity extras
The sample projects both use some Serenity features which make configuring the tests easier. In particular, Serenity uses the `serenity.conf` file in the `src/test/resources` directory to configure test execution options.  
### Webdriver configuration
The WebDriver configuration is managed entirely from this file, as illustrated below:
```java
webdriver {
    driver = chrome
}
headless.mode = true

chrome.switches="""--start-maximized;--test-type;--no-sandbox;--ignore-certificate-errors;
                   --disable-popup-blocking;--disable-default-apps;--disable-extensions-file-access-check;
                   --incognito;--disable-infobars,--disable-gpu"""

```

Serenity uses WebDriverManager to download the WebDriver binaries automatically before the tests are executed.

### Environment-specific configurations
We can also configure environment-specific properties and options, so that the tests can be run in different environments. Here, we configure three environments, __dev__, _staging_ and _prod_, with different starting URLs for each:
```json
environments {
  default {
    webdriver.base.url = "https://duckduckgo.com"
  }
  dev {
    webdriver.base.url = "https://duckduckgo.com/dev"
  }
  staging {
    webdriver.base.url = "https://duckduckgo.com/staging"
  }
  prod {
    webdriver.base.url = "https://duckduckgo.com/prod"
  }
}
```

You use the `environment` system property to determine which environment to run against. For example to run the tests in the staging environment, you could run:
```json
$ mvn clean verify -Denvironment=staging
```
